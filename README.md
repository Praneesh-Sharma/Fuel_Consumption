# Fuel Consumption
A machine learning project that predicts the fuel consumption.


I have made 2 models, one using multiple linear regression, other using a decision tree. These models predict the fuel consumption of a particular vehicle if certain other features are provided to it.

I was given a dataset consisting of Miles per Gallon(MPG) and other related features(like cylinders, horsepower, acceleration, and weight) of cars across various contries like Europe, Germany and Japan.

### Concept :
The fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on various things like it's weight, acceleration, horsepower, the number of cylinders in the engine and how old the car is. So, I have model based on multiple linear regression to make the predictions, if the other conditions are given.
